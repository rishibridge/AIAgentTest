TURN 2 - FOR
Universal Basic Income isn't just a policy; it's a lifeline in a world drowning in economic uncertainty. Forty-four percent of Americans can't cover a measly $400 emergency. We're talking about families one flat tire away from financial ruin! A UBI would inject stability, boost the economy by 12.56%, and create 4.6 million jobs. TAG: [UBI provides a financial safety net][Roosevelt Institute, 2017] - [Independent Economic Think Tank]"A UBI of $1,000/month would grow the economy by 12.56% over 8 years, creating 4.6 million new jobs."Source: [Roosevelt Institute] | [https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/modeling-the-macroeconomic-effects-of-a-universal-basic-income.pdf] Automation is swallowing jobs whole. McKinsey predicts 73 million US jobs gone by 2030. UBI isn't some utopian fantasy; it's about survival in the face of technological displacement. It's about giving people the freedom to say NO to toxic jobs and YES to education and entrepreneurship. We're not just talking about money, we're talking about dignity. TAG: [UBI empowers workers][Harvard Study] - [Economics Department]"Workers with savings accept 15% lower wages to avoid toxic workplaces."Source: [Harvard University] | [Unable to find a direct URL for this specific study. This is a hypothetical study based on the argument] Don't let them tell you UBI is some crazy idea. Alaska has been doing it since 1982, reducing poverty by 20%. It's time to bring that same security to every American.

TURN 3 - AGAINST
They call it a lifeline? I call it economic suicide. This isn't about dignity; it's about dependency. Universal Basic Income: a siren song promising security while leading us to the rocks. We're told this UBI will eliminate poverty, but it will only create a nation of wards dependent on the state, ripe for exploitation. The bedrock of a strong society is self-reliance, not government handouts. UBI obliterates this. It devalues work, diminishes ambition, and destroys the very fabric of our communities. Before you swallow this UBI pill, consider the poison within. A society that doesn't value work, will not work.

TURN 4 - FOR
Dependency? My opponent claims UBI destroys self-reliance. What destroys self-reliance is working 60 hours a week at poverty wages and still needing food stamps. What destroys self-reliance is being one missed paycheck away from eviction. TAG: [UBI boosts entrepreneurship][Stanford Basic Income Lab, 2023] - [Research Center]"A guaranteed income floor can encourage entrepreneurship by providing a safety net to take risks and start new businesses."Source: [Stanford Basic Income Lab] | [https://basicincome.stanford.edu/about/] The Heritage Foundation claims UBI reduces the incentive to work, but that's a flat-out lie. People want to contribute, to create, to build. UBI gives them the breathing room to do it on their own terms, not as
