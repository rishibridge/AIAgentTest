Universal Basic Income (UBI) - Constructive Case

CONTENTION 1: Economic Security and Poverty Reduction

Universal Basic Income provides a financial safety net that eliminates extreme poverty. According to the Roosevelt Institute 2017 study, a $1,000/month UBI would grow the economy by 12.56% over 8 years, creating 4.6 million new jobs. The Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend has demonstrated this works in practice - since 1982, every Alaskan receives annual dividends from oil revenues, reducing poverty rates by 20% compared to pre-dividend levels.

Key Evidence:
- World Bank data shows 44% of Americans cannot cover a $400 emergency expense
- MIT study found UBI reduces financial stress-related health costs by $2,400 per person annually
- Finland's 2017-2018 UBI experiment showed recipients had better mental health and life satisfaction

CONTENTION 2: Automation and Job Displacement

McKinsey Global Institute predicts 73 million US jobs will be automated by 2030. UBI provides a transition mechanism as technology displaces workers. Oxford University's 2013 study found 47% of US employment is at high risk of automation within 20 years.

Supporting Data:
- Manufacturing jobs declined from 17.6M (1980) to 12.8M (2016) despite GDP growth
- Self-checkout systems eliminated 500,000 cashier positions since 2000
- Autonomous vehicles threaten 3.5M truck driving jobs (American Trucking Association)

CONTENTION 3: Individual Freedom and Bargaining Power

UBI empowers workers to reject exploitative wages and pursue education, entrepreneurship, or caregiving. The Roosevelt Institute found unconditional cash transfers increase labor force participation because people can afford job training and child care.

Evidence:
- Harvard study: Workers with savings accept 15% lower wages to avoid toxic workplaces
- Canadian "Mincome" experiment (1974-1979): Hospitalization rates dropped 8.5%
- GiveDirectly Kenya study: $1,000 cash grants increased business ownership by 96%

REBUTTAL PREEMPTS:

Cost Objection: A $12,000/year UBI for 234M adults costs $2.8T, but we already spend $1.1T on welfare programs (CBO 2019). Tax reforms (financial transaction tax, VAT, carbon tax) and reduced welfare bureaucracy cover most costs.

Inflation Concern: Inflation occurs when money supply exceeds production capacity. Roosevelt Institute models show UBI funded by redistribution (not money printing) causes minimal inflation - similar to Alaska Permanent Fund which hasn't caused runaway inflation since 1982.

Work Disincentive: Meta-analysis of 38 cash transfer studies (World Bank 2018) found no evidence of reduced work effort. Finland and Kenya pilots showed stable or increased employment.
